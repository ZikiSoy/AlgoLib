* [Biconnected component](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconnected_component)

> In graph theory, a **biconnected component** (or **2-connected component**) is a maximal biconnected subgraph. Any connected graph decomposes into a tree of biconnected components called the **block tree** of the graph. The blocks are attached to each other at shared vertices called **cut vertices** or **articulation points**. Specifically, a **cut vertex** is any vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components.

* [Bridge (graph theory)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_%28graph_theory%29)

> In graph theory, a **bridge** (also known as a **cut-edge** or **cut arc** or an **isthmus**) is an edge whose deletion increases the number of connected components. Equivalently, an edge is a bridge if and only if it is not contained in any cycle. A graph is said to be **bridgeless** if it contains no bridges.

> The **bridge-block tree** of the graph has a vertex for every nontrivial **2-edge-connected** and an edge for every bridge.
