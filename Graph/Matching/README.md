## Covering and Matching

#### Wiki

> In any graph without isolated vertices, the sum of the **matching number**
> and the **edge covering number** equals the number of vertices. If there is a
> perfect matching, then both the matching number and the edge cover number are
> |V| / 2.

> A set is independent if and only if its complement is a vertex cover. The sum
> of the size of a **maximum independent set** α(G) and the size of a **minimum
> vertex cover** β(G) is the number of vertices in the graph.

> A set is independent if and only if it is a clique in the graph's complement,
> so the two concepts are complementary.

> In a bipartite graph with no isolated vertices, the number of vertices in a
> **maximum independent set** equals the number of edges in a **minimum edge
> covering**; this is König's theorem.
